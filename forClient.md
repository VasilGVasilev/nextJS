Server-side rendering (SSR) can offer several benefits for Google web crawlers and SEO. Here are some reasons why SSR websites are often considered favorable:

    Improved Crawling and Indexing: SSR allows the server to render the complete HTML content of a webpage before sending it to the client. This means that search engine crawlers can easily access and parse the fully rendered content, leading to better indexing of your website's pages. SSR eliminates the need for additional JavaScript execution on the client-side to generate the content, ensuring search engines can readily understand the page's structure and content.

    Enhanced Page Load Speed: With SSR, the initial HTML content is already generated on the server, reducing the time required for the page to load. This faster load speed is beneficial for search engine optimization as search engines prioritize websites that provide a better user experience, including faster loading times. Additionally, improved load speed can reduce bounce rates and increase user engagement, further positively impacting SEO.

    Facilitates Web Accessibility: Server-side rendering is advantageous for web accessibility since it generates HTML content that is readily accessible to different user agents, including assistive technologies used by individuals with disabilities. By ensuring your website is accessible, you can reach a wider audience and potentially gain better search engine rankings.

    Social Media and Link Previews: When sharing a URL on social media platforms or in messaging apps, they often generate a preview of the page containing a title, description, and thumbnail. Since SSR provides the complete HTML content on the initial request, these previews can be accurately generated without relying on additional JavaScript execution. This is important for click-through rates when sharing your website's links on social media platforms, thus indirectly impacting SEO.

    Compatibility with Older Browsers and Search Engines: Some web crawlers or user agents may not support or execute JavaScript properly. By adopting SSR, you ensure that your website's content is accessible and visible to a wider range of browsers and search engines, including those with limited JavaScript capabilities.

    It's worth noting that server-side rendering may not be the best approach for every website. For highly interactive or real-time applications, a combination of SSR and client-side rendering (CSR) techniques, known as hybrid rendering, can be beneficial. Hybrid rendering allows for dynamic content updates on the client-side while providing initial server-rendered content for better SEO and performance.
