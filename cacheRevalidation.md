Next.js's cache revalidation is a feature that allows for automatic updating of cached data in a Next.js application. It is particularly useful when working with data that may change over time, such as data fetched from an external API.

When a page is rendered in Next.js, the result is typically cached on the server and sent to the client. By default, this cached version of the page is served to subsequent visitors until it expires. However, with cache revalidation, Next.js provides a way to periodically check if the data has changed since the initial rendering.

Here's how the cache revalidation process works:

    1. When a page is first rendered, Next.js stores the rendered HTML in the cache along with a timestamp.
    2. When a subsequent request is made to the same page, Next.js checks the timestamp in the cache.
    3. If the timestamp is within a certain time threshold (known as the revalidate period), Next.js serves the cached version of the page to the visitor.
    4. Concurrently, Next.js sends a background request to the API or data source associated with the page to check if the data has been updated.
    5. If the data has changed, Next.js triggers a re-render of the page, updates the cache with the new HTML, and serves it to subsequent visitors.
    6. If the data has not changed, Next.js continues to serve the cached version of the page until the next revalidation attempt.

This cache revalidation process ensures that visitors receive up-to-date content while minimizing unnecessary API requests. The revalidate period can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the application. Additionally, Next.js provides options to handle loading states during the revalidation process, such as showing a loading indicator or a stale version of the content.

Cache revalidation is especially beneficial in scenarios where the data changes infrequently or where real-time data is not crucial. It strikes a balance between performance and freshness of the content in Next.js applications.

# For this app we will use Background Revalidation since there is no CMS and data fetching to implement on-demand Revalidation
- only for apartments' status since it will be changing when released
