## Building approach:
- Chose create-react-app since the app will be Front-end disply of available apartments with no CRUD operations on the DB apart from GET requests.
- Decide on a CSS superset Tailwind or SASS based mainly on the instruments' capability to deliver seamless mobile resposniveness, but also useMap for mapping pictures to relevant routes.
- Hosting will most likely be Hostinger
- DB will also most likely be Hostinger depending on how well it connects with the website for GET requests, thus, no separate admin page for CRUD of DB.

1. Choose a CSS superset.
 - Mobile responsiveness
 - Mapping pictures
