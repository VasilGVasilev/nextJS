What does Next.js offer in comporison to React?
- Rendering flexibility between client side and server side rendering, the latter providing immediate display via pre-rendering, thus, better SEO 
- File-based routing system
- possible fullstack app via route.js
- code-splitting is automatic -> Loading.js, not all the lazy import, <Supsense /> in traditional React
