With Next.js the default approach is dependant on the the final result, we want a static or a full-stack app. If static, we make a ssg. SSG is pre-rendered code so that the only requests are to the hosting server and the return is HTML. You may enable client side rendering (the defualt is server side which most importantly is not in conflict with haveing SSG, namely, build time not run time app). However, this client side rendering is not the best option if fetching is aimed, it is okay for state. The whole idea behind Next.js in its recent development is to enable Server Components, thus, Server Side Rendering, which pre-renders everyhting on a running server and the fetches from browser client to that server recieve a similar end effect as if the app was SSG, thus, build time.
