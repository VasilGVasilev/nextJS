# In general:


Disabling cache is one way to ensure that end users see the updated version of a website immediately after changes are made. However, it's not the only way to handle this situation. There are a few other techniques you can use to ensure that users see the latest version of your website without disabling the cache completely. Here are a few options:

    Cache Busting: You can implement cache busting techniques to force browsers to fetch the updated assets instead of relying on the cached versions. This involves appending a unique query string or version number to the URL of the asset each time it changes. For example, instead of referencing a CSS file as "styles.css," you can use "styles.css?v=2" or "styles-2.css" to indicate a new version. This change in the URL will make the browser recognize it as a different file and fetch the latest version.

    Asset Versioning: You can also use asset versioning by including a version number or timestamp in the filename itself. For example, instead of "styles.css," you can use "styles-v1.2.3.css" or "styles-20230530.css" to indicate the version or date. By updating the filename when changes are made, you ensure that the browser recognizes it as a new file and retrieves the latest version.

    HTTP Headers: You can configure your web server to send appropriate HTTP headers to control caching behavior. By setting the appropriate caching headers, such as "Cache-Control" and "Expires," you can specify how long the browser should cache the assets. You can set a short expiration time for assets that change frequently or disable caching altogether during development and testing phases.

    Meta Tags: Adding appropriate meta tags to your HTML pages can also control caching behavior. The "Cache-Control" meta tag can be used to specify caching directives for individual pages, such as "no-cache" or "no-store," which can instruct the browser not to cache the page or its assets.

It's worth noting that while these techniques can help ensure users see the updated version of your website, some caching may still occur in certain circumstances. Users who have previously visited your site may have some assets cached on their devices, and some intermediaries (such as CDNs or proxies) may also cache content. However, by implementing cache-busting techniques, setting appropriate caching headers, and leveraging meta tags, you can significantly minimize caching issues and improve the chances of users seeing the latest version of your website.

# In Next.js you can specify to revalidate cache on each page via:

sh```export const revalidate = 0; // revalidate this page every 60 seconds```

this will always fetch the latest version of the page from the hosting service provider
